I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, madame, with you
My heart won't let my feet do things that they should do

You know what? You're lovely
You know what? You're so lovely
And, oh, what you do to me
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor
